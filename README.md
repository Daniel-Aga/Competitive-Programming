# Competitive Programming
This is my personal repository for competitive-programming-related code and material.

You are welcome to use any part of it in your own projects. 

Note that there may be mistakes in some of the algorithms, and some parts of the code are more tested than others. Copy the code at your own risk.
Also, if you do find a mistake, I would be very thankful if you let me know about it.
